Tickets related to those will be closed without further action.\nGitHub test stacks repository: [https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/oci-hpc/tree/master/playbooks](https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/oci-hpc/tree/master/playbooks). Reach out to the Solutions Architects in #oci-hpc-int\n\n**Rule 3: Support for Compute HPC Images only**\nWe offer support exclusively for Compute HPC Images. Please refer to the following link to access the supported Compute HPC Images: [Compute HPC Images](https://objectstorage.eu-frankfurt-1.oraclecloud.com/p/_601lOOXFu5ordAFijwzLPduQ_3To16jFrej0JmxEdz1iKkr2BzqBudhqQ9uikLg/n/hpc/b/exported-compute-hpc-images/o/)\n\n**Rule 4: Provide OCIDs for every issue**\nWhen reporting an issue, please provide the relevant OCIDs (Instance OCIDs, Cluster Network OCIDs) associated with the problem. This information will help us investigate and resolve the issue more effectively.\n\n**Rule 5: Include SOSReports and NVIDIA debug logs for GPU issues**\nFor GPU-related issues, please include the SOSReports logs and NVIDIA debug logs. These logs are valuable for troubleshooting. Please follow the instructions below to obtain them:\n- To collect SOSReports logs, run the command `sudo sosreport`.\n- To collect NVIDIA debug logs, execute the command `sudo nvidia-bug-report.sh`.\n\n**Rule 6: Stay positive!
