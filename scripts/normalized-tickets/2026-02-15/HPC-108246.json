For example see what tickets are identified for 2553XQ103W, but we are only blocking on HPC. The DO ticket is not on the list.\n\n[opc@cpv-host-aga ~]$ cpv state read -t host -k 2553XQ103W | jq '.[] | .tickets'\n2026/02/10 20:20:46 Reading state file state.json\n2026/02/10 20:20:47 Object Store client initialized with host url https://objectstorage.us-saltlake-2.oraclecloud.com\n\n  \"CPV-422 AGA\nSince this is happening on this instance only it doesn't seem to be a widespread problem, if not all hosts would be missing their corresponding DO tickets.\n\nEdit\nDelete\n\nLazaro Morales Pino added a comment - 10/Feb/2026 02:24:14PM -0600Permalink\nI added the serial to the summary in DO-2649612.
